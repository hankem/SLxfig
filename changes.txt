Changes since 0.1.0

1. src/xfig/plot.sl: modified major/minor axis routines to better deal
   with tic marks that span many orders of magnitude for log plots.
2. src/xfig/plot.sl: If a log-axis does not include a point 10^n, then
   use linear tics-marks.
3. src/xfig/plot.sl: Allow major/minor tic positions to be specified.
4. src/xfig/core.sl: Changed the way the colors are indexed to allow
   and allow colors to be specified by index.
5. src/xfig/polyline.sl: pict_scale was using the wrong object.
6. src/xfig/plot.sl: Use \times instead of \cdot for labels in the alt format
7. src/xfig/plot.sl: If a sym qualifier is given, do not draw lines unless
   line is also specified.
8. src/xfig/plot.sl: hplot method added for plotting histograms.
9. src/xfig/plot.sl: get_*_depth functions included a depth argument
10. src/xfig/plot.sl: Avoid the use of (@Array_Type) to create an array.
11. src/xfig/core.sl: Added orange, orange2-4 colors.
12. src/xfig/core.sl: All objects get set_pen_color, set_area_fill,
    set_thickness, set_lines_style, and set_fill_color methods.
13. src/xfig/objects.sl: Added qualifier support to a few functions.
14. src/xfig/polyline.sl: Added "just" qualifier to the xfig_new_pict
    function to specify its local coordinate system origin.

    old code to use this version of xfig.
16. src/xfig/latex.sl: Added qualifier support to allow the "just"
    qualifier to propagate into the xfig_new_pict function.
17. examples/plot.sl: Tweaked some of the examples
18. src/xfig/plot.sl: plot_symbols now uses a polyline_list instead of
    individual polylines.  This makes it run faster when many points
    are involved.
19. src/xfig/core.sl: If an integer is passed to xfig_lookup_color,
    the value returned will be modulo num_colors.
20. src/xfig/polyline.sl: Use xfig_lookup_color in set_color methods.

    improve performance.
25. src/xfig/plot.sl: added areafill and fillcolor qualifiers to the
    xfig_new_legend function.

    absolute position of the pict.
27. src/xfig/plot.sl: Added support for plotting via mixed world
    systems, e.g., world12, world21, etc.  Also, world0 may be used to
    refer to device coordinates, which run from 0 to 1.
28. src/xfig/plot.sl: The hplot method will call the shaded histogram
    routine if a fill qualifier is given.
29. examples/plot/world.sl: A new example.  Also some other examples
    were updated.

    additional elements to the preamble.
45. A preamble=value qualifier added to the latex functions to add
    additional lines to the latex preamble.
46. src/xfig/plot.sl: Added xfig_plot_get/set_default_size functions
    for setting the default plot sizes (w=14, h=10 are the defaults).

    _xfig_version_string track the changes.txt file.
60. src/xfig/plot.sl: The "ticlabels" qualifier to the plot functions may
    be used to specify user-defined labels.  See the
    examples/plot/ticlabels.sl for examples.  (Manfred Hanke).

         w = xfig_plot_new ();
	   .
	   .
	 world = w.get_world();  % ==> xmin=world[0], xmax=world[1],...

75. src/xfig/plot.sl: The "depth" qualifier may be a reference to a
    variable, which if NULL, will be set upon return to the depth used:
