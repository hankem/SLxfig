Changes since 0.1.0

1. src/xfig/plot.sl: modified major/minor axis routines to better deal
   with tic marks that span many orders of magnitude for log plots.
2. src/xfig/plot.sl: If a log-axis does not include a point 10^n, then
   use linear tics-marks.
3. src/xfig/plot.sl: Allow major/minor tic positions to be specified.
4. src/xfig/core.sl: Changed the way the colors are indexed to allow
   and allow colors to be specified by index.
5. src/xfig/polyline.sl: pict_scale was using the wrong object.
6. src/xfig/plot.sl: Use \times instead of \cdot for labels in the alt format
7. src/xfig/plot.sl: If a sym qualifier is given, do not draw lines unless
   line is also specified.
8. src/xfig/plot.sl: hplot method added for plotting histograms.
9. src/xfig/plot.sl: get_*_depth functions included a depth argument
10. src/xfig/plot.sl: Avoid the use of (@Array_Type) to create an array.
11. src/xfig/core.sl: Added orange, orange2-4 colors.
12. src/xfig/core.sl: All objects get set_pen_color, set_area_fill,
    set_thickness, set_lines_style, and set_fill_color methods.
13. src/xfig/objects.sl: Added qualifier support to a few functions.
14. src/xfig/polyline.sl: Added "just" qualifier to the xfig_new_pict

    qualifier to propagate into the xfig_new_pict function.
17. examples/plot.sl: Tweaked some of the examples
18. src/xfig/plot.sl: plot_symbols now uses a polyline_list instead of
    individual polylines.  This makes it run faster when many points
    are involved.
19. src/xfig/core.sl: If an integer is passed to xfig_lookup_color,
    the value returned will be modulo num_colors.

    refer to device coordinates, which run from 0 to 1.
28. src/xfig/plot.sl: The hplot method will call the shaded histogram
    routine if a fill qualifier is given.
29. examples/plot/world.sl: A new example.  Also some other examples

    additional lines to the latex preamble.
46. src/xfig/plot.sl: Added xfig_plot_get/set_default_size functions

     normals.
107. src/xfig/core.sl: autoload readascii (Thomas Dauser).

     default is 0.
112. src/xfig/plot.sl: xfig_plot_new supports ticlabel qualifiers to
     define defaults.
113. Merged Manfred's updates:

         (See examples/transparent/README)

114. mandlebrot.sl,font-style.sl: minor (cosmetic) tweaks: z^2 -> z*z
     and avoid \ at end of string literal (so that editors such as jed

     2) for rotated text (Sebastian Falkner).
117. src/xfig/plot.sl: %.add_object was not working correctly if a log
     qualifier was given and was called before %.plot. To fix this
     %.add_object now initializes the plot. (Sebastian Falkner)
118. avoid empty line in .fig file for a polyline with n x 16
     vertices, which does not work with some versions of fig2dev.
     (Manfred Hanke)

     one larger than the y array.
